I'm a passionate cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Blue Team operations and SOC analysis. Currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity Engineer, I enjoy tackling challenges related to security systems, ethical hacking, and database management. I have hands-on experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL, and I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my skills. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!

## Objective

As I progress through my journey in computer science, my growing passion for cybersecurity has inspired me to transition fully into this field. My goal is to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my foundational knowledge and continuously develop my skills in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring.
